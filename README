This is a type and a provider for managing sudoers file.

It still has a lot of issues open, but it should be in a consumable state.


TODO(stuff that I will fix before 0.1 release)

  1. A userspec record that starts with Defaults will be parsed as a default. (this may not be possible)
  2. I still need to verify combinations of properties that work together and throw exceptions for mismatches.
  3. I can probably set up autorequires on aliases in User Spec line, but this order would only be followed if both records were created.
  4. If an alias is created with the same name as a previously defined user spec, it does not create it, or throw any errors.
  5 Should not print out flush or to_line because of performance issue.

LIMITATIONS (things I will not fix soon):

  1. No support for parsing multi-line files (with \). I may add this in the next revision.
  2. Forced to use comments to specify NAMEVARS. This means that there is no
  way to determine if an added line is the same as an existing line.
  3. Dependencies are only aplied between records at creation time. It is not possible to insert a new record before an existing one. There is probably a good way to fix this, but I need more time to look into it. Currently discussing with dev, this will require a feature request in parsedfile??
  4. Performance issue with parsedfile- seems to be runing to_line way too many times, also flushing way too often

  
COMMENT NAMEVARS:

I have chosen (or been forced to) implement NAMEVARS using comments. This adds a ton of complexity to the code and its usage. This also means that identical lines will be allowed provided that they have the same namevar. 

I have to do this dirty pre-line stuff for user_spec.
  I had considered requiring uniqueness for the user-spec
    this does when considering that an alias can also be a user spec user, this violates uniqueness.
